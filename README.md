# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

---

This project is a sentiment analysis of tweets during the 2012 presidential election. Tweets are determined to be about Obama or Romney by a rule based approach. Sentiment scores are analyzed using Natural Language Tool-Kit. Tweet volumes, distributions, and frequencies are also analyzed. The `HW04_twitterData.json.txt.gz` file is empty in this repository as it belongs to the University of Vermont.
